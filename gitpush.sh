# Script: gitpush.sh
# Purpose: Automatically retry `git push` with arguments until success
#          or max retries reached.
# Handles timeouts (e.g., due to network provider) and other failures.
# Usage: ./gitpush.sh [any git push arguments, e.g. origin dev]
# Note: It's user's pesponsibility for safe command.
#       Only works well on Linux systems. We have not test it on MacOS.

# Maximum number of retries
MAX_RETRIES=100

# Timeout for git push (in seconds)

# Loop until git push succeeds or the maximum number of retries is reached

        echo "Git push succeeded!"

    elif [ $push_exit_code -eq 124 ]; then
        # Git push timed out (likely waiting for user input)
        echo "Git push timed out (possibly waiting for user input). Retrying..."
    else

        echo "Git push failed with exit code $push_exit_code. Retrying..."

    retry_count=$((retry_count + 1))

# If the maximum number of retries is reached without success
echo "Maximum retries reached ($MAX_RETRIES attempts), git push still failed."
